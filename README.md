    VR is a great way to reduce clutter of physical toys and engage spatial perception skills! Here are a few the kids have enjoyed over the years:

I think what you're doing right now (have Allison play what you play) is the best strategy.

Let's see... according to Winry's gaming spreadsheet, it looks like she enjoyed playing Mario¹ and learned to read from Pokemon at around age 4½. She did Metroid: Zero Mission around that time and really enjoyed being Samus and exploring for secrets. She also liked Journey (https://store.steampowered.com/app/638230/Journey/) and Flower. 

Monument Valley 1 and 2 for iOS were charming 3D puzzle / spatial reasoning games featuring a girl protagonist. The Dragonbox series of games helped the kids get a good conceptual and visual grasp of numbers as opposed to memorizing symbols. Dragonbox Elements was amazing and taught them geometry in a very sneaky way, while Dragonbox algebra trained them to think about abstract algebraic concepts, also in a sneaky way!

Winry had fun early on with Pokemon Art Academy and Art Academy, learning about digital art and using layers in her compositions on her 3DS. This helped her transition to Procreate later on the iPad for all of her handwriting and proofwriting.

There's a cute Mario themed puzzle game called Captain Toad which is a charming 3D puzzler. The Box Boy series of games on the Switch and 3DS were a huge hit with both, especially because they were co-op.

The kids loved rhythm games, which ended up being a sneaky way to introduce them to music. In Patapon, you have four drums that you beat to tell your small army to attack, defend, and perform combat manuevers versus giant cartoon monsters. Theatrhythm has wonderful Final Fantasy music and encouraged Cody to explore a lot of songs on the piano. Much of the music is present in Final Fantasy XIV, a AAA MMORPG the four of us play as a family. Crypt of the Necrodancer and Cadence of Hyrule were also good rhythm / RPG hybrids.

As a 6/7 year old she started enjoying bigger RPGs like Breath of the Wild and Horizon: Zero Dawn. ➜ scientist, survival, ethics, 

surprised with chess. thought it was a trash game but surprisingly deep and all four of us play it, all terribly.

co-op games. Overcooked. 

FFXIV. adv story with politics, but good mmo mechanics. 4 player party.

Contraption Maker is something Bob might remember. I think it's from the makers of the original Incredible Machine, a physics based puzzle game with every-day objects. 

Infinifactory. 

There are also great games in VR that both kids enjoyed. Puzzling Places is a good 3D puzzle game where you literally put together puzzle pieces in 3D. Cubism and Gadgeteer were huge hits with both kids, as were Moss, Fujii, and Down the Rabbit Hole. Beat Saber is a great exercise game, as was Ring Fit for Nintendo Switch. ➜ Just Dance!

Recently the kids both did ALBA, Equilinox and In Other Waters, all very naturey / biology related games. 

As Allison gets older you can consider playing historical games with her, like the Assassin's Creed or Total War series.

We also enjoyed many indie classics throughout the years with the kids, like Hollow Knight, Celeste (Cody spent 7 months playing through the OST for that), 



how P5 is a good family reading experience. 


¹ super mario 3D world, super mario galaxy 2, super mario bros. U, mario kart 8
